<!--
Describe your issue and what you'd like to be done about it quickly. If you
intend to implement the solution yourself, you don't need to file a bug before
a pull request.

Note that the maintainer will only take note of issues added to the "continuous
backlog" project. Click "Projects -> continous backlog" on the right hand side
of the issue box and correctly tag your issue as "bug", "enhancement" or
"question" depending on its purpose. This way it'll be visible in the work
queue.
