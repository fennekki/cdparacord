# Contributor guidelines

If you have a feature you specifically need, prioritise sending pull requests
over tagging the maintainer in a new issue. Similarly, if you have already
implemented a new feature you think should be merged, submit a pull request.

Patches to existing issues should be sent as pull requests, and the pull request
should contain one of github's [ways of closing issues via pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in the
pull request body or one of its commits, so merging it automatically closes that
issue.

Label all pull requests and issues as "bug", "enhancement" or "question"
depending on what their function is, or what kind of an issue they fix. Also,
add any pull requests and issues you wish the maintainer to see to the
"continous backlog" project.

Do not assign anyone except yourself to an issue or a pull request without their
explicit permission to do so.
